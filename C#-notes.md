C# vs .NET
🚀 C# → Object-oriented programming language
⚙️ .NET → Framework to run and develop applications

🔹 Key Differences
Feature	C#	.NET
Type	Language	Framework/Runtime
Purpose	Writing code	/ Running & managing code
Platform	Any (can be compiled for different platforms)	Windows (.NET Framework) / Cross-platform (.NET Core & .NET 5+)
Usage	Can be used independently	/ Provides libraries/APIs for C# and other languages

🔹 Relationship Between C# and .NET
✅ C# code needs .NET to run → C# compiles into Intermediate Language (IL), which the .NET runtime executes.
✅ .NET provides tools & libraries for C# development, including frameworks like ASP.NET, Entity Framework, and Blazor.

📌 Conclusion: C# is just a language, while .NET is the ecosystem that supports and enhances C# development.
